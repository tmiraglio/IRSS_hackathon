Anthropogenic land use change is leading to rapid and irreversible changes in ecosystem function and habitat availability for wildlife. Habitat degradation through the development of power plants across North America are exerting pressure on a range of mammalian species. A critical keystone species throughout temperate and boreal forests, the health of Bigfoot (Homo sapiens cognatus) populations are being threatened by these large-scale energy projects. Previous research shows that coal and nuclear power plants have negative effects on Bigfoot health through leakage of radioactive material and lax environmental protection policy. In order to better protect this important species, more research is needed to understand the impacts of different energy sources on Bigfoot populations.      
The goal of this research is to understand the impacts of power development on Bigfoot occurrence across North America. Specifically, are Bigfoot more likely to be found in closer proximity to clean energy sources such as solar or wind compared to coal and nuclear? 

Our results clearly show that Bigfoot occurence is positively correlated with clean energy sources (i.e. solar and wind). This suggests that Bigfoot preferentially select less polluted habitat. The further development of clean energy sources will thus be important to ensure the health of this endangered species.
